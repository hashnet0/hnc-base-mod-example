# HashNet HNC-BCM Example

This is a HNC (HashNet Container) BCM (Base Container Module) repo that acts as a example or template for other modules.

The `run.sh` file is mandatory for the module even if it contains no text. It is the entry point to the module.

The `cron.txt` is an optional file which if it exists will automatically be copied over to the hnc-base system's `/etc/cron.d/` directory.
